## Hi there 👋

#### A Senior AI Fullstack Developer day ☼ and night ☾

🚀 With over 3 years of experience in the AI field, I specialize in developing cutting-edge enterprise AI solutions. My focus is on leveraging advanced technologies, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to create AI-powered applications that meet real-world business needs while gaining valuable insights into user behavior.

👨‍🏭 As a Senior Fullstack AI Developer, I lead and mentor development teams, setting coding standards and best practices for both frontend and backend. My strong background in app development keeps me at the forefront of UI/UX innovation and AI-driven product development.

🛠️ My tech stack includes Python, Vue Js, TypeScript, C++, React JS, Docker, Tailwind, Git, RestFul API, LLama-Index

🔐 I'm well-versed in industry-standard authentication protocols like oAuth2, and I seamlessly integrate authorization into UI frameworks to ensure secure and robust applications.

🧠 I’m deeply involved in LLM and RAG projects, pushing the boundaries of AI and enhancing intelligent system capabilities.

📚 Currently learning rust programming language

Let's connect and build the future together! 🌟
